*I first started by trying to interperate my data so i cleaned it up a little by putting it into a table and checking whether each section is correctly formatted based on the records.
I decided to add a column with the name "Usage Status" as i knew i wanted to focus on the subject of how Phone usage time would effect the students. I did some research on the recommended hrs of daily phone usage, then using an "IF" statement i was able to create a column with records that were either divided into either; "Normal" if the Average Hours were below 6, and "High" if the Average Hours were above 6.*

*I opened a pivot table in a different sheet then grouped the data i wanted to use & with this i was able to view the sum of phone usage hours by; Age, Country, and Gender. 
I then made a small table of how much phone hours were being used per age and country, to easily interperate the long list of data.
Then lastly i made a column chart to display which countries clearly had more total usage hours that the others.*

*I opened up a Pivot Table in another slide with the now transformed data and was able to manipulate and group the data to compare and find clearer insights.
With this i was able to find the average hrs of sleep that each of the academic levels and put it into a sub-table in order for easier readabilty. 
Considering this, i wanted to see if i could find any potential correlations between any of the other categories, so i grouped the "average sleep hrs" with the "mental health score" of the students.
I then used visualisation methods such as conditional formatting to clearly interperate whether the records in the column have a positive or negative impact. Then i decided to use a line graph to display whether there was a correlation between the two, and the results seemed to be in sync.*
