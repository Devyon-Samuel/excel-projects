*I first started by trying to interperate my data so i cleaned it up a little by putting it into a table and checking whether each section is correctly formatted based on the records.
I decided to add a column with the name "Usage Status" as i knew i wanted to focus on the subject of how Phone usage time would effect the students. I did some research on the recommended hrs of daily phone usage, then using an "IF" statement i was able to create a column with records that were either divided into either; "Normal" if the Average Hours were below 6, and "High" if the Average Hours were above 6.*
